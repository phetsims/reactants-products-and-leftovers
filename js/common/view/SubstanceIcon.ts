/**
 * Displays a Substance's icon, which may change dynamically.
 *
 * VERY IMPORTANT NOTES!
 *
 * Scenery is a DAG and allows one instance of a Node to appear in the scene graph in
 * multiple places, with 2 caveats: (1) a Node cannot be a sibling of itself, and (2)
 * transforming a node will do so everywhere that it appears. Because an icon can
 * appear in multiple places in the view, this type provides a convenient way to
 * wrap an icon, so that we don't accidentally make it a sibling of itself, or
 * attempt to position it.  It also ensures that the icon's origin (0,0) is at the
 * center of its bounds, which we take advantage of in layout code.
 *
 * Substances typically have a lifetime that is longer than this node.
 * When this node is disposed of, the icon needs to be explicitly removed from its parent.
 * This is because scenery nodes keep a reference to their parent. If we don't explicitly
 * remove the icon from the scene graph, then all of its ancestors will be retained,
 * creating a memory leak.
