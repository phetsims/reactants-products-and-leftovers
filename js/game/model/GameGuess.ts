/**
 * A 'guess' is the user's answer to a game challenge, and it may or may not be correct.
 * We call it a 'guess' to distinguish the user's answer from the correct answer.
 * (And yes, 'guess' is semantically incorrect, since a guess is uninformed. Live with it :-)
 *
 * A guess is constructed based on a reaction and challenge type.
 * The guess will have the same number of reactants and products as the reaction,
 * and they are guaranteed to be in the same order.
 * Depending on the challenge type, values in the guess will be initialized to zero.
 *
 * A guess is correct if the reaction and guess have the same quantities of reactants,
 * products and leftovers.
 *
 * Run with the 'playAll' or 'playOne' query parameter to fill in the correct answer.
